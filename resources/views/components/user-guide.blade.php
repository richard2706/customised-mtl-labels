    <p>Scan any product's barcode then you will be shown its traffic light nutrition label. This provides a visual representation of the nutritional value of one portion of the product.</p>
    <p>If you log in, then you can customise for each nutrient, when the traffic light label shows it as green, amber or red.</p>
    <p>You can also customise your daily maximum for each nutrient, then the percentages will reflect the amount each nutrient (in one portion of the product) contributes to your daily maximum.</p>
